Webpage to play albums

There's a lot of music players out there.  A lot have bells and whistles that I'm not interested when I just want to play
my albums.  So here's a simple little player with a fun cassette tape animation.  It shows the cover art and the track list.

The player needs no installation. It uses the HTML5 audio player built into most browsers.  Just put the following files in the root of your album
directory (or use absolute paths in your xml file).

More info in the instructions.txt file.
